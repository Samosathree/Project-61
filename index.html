        <p>I like to dance sometimes to k-pop with youtube videos of just dance.If you don't know what k-pop is, it is korean pop and even though it might sound weird, it is one of the best types of music EVER and I dance to groups like Blackpink,KDA and Itzy because those are groups I like!Dancing is also a GREAT form of exersize so I also get fit while having fun while listening to my favorite k-pop groups!</p>
